    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic beef stroganoff recipe is a fairly lean version, as most recipes call for more cream. This is something you can easily adjust to your tastes.<br> I like a little thicker version, with just enough sauce to coat the meat. Serve over buttered noodles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, sliced or diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season beef generously with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Stir in beef; cook, stirring constantly, for 6 to 7 minutes, until liquid evaporates and meat browns. </li>
        <li>Remove meat from the pan and set aside. Stir mushrooms, onions, and butter into the pan; cook and stir over medium heat until vegetables are lightly browned. </li>
        <li>Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in flour; cook for 1 to 2 minutes until incorporated. Stir in wine and 1 cup of broth, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens, about 3 to 4 minutes. </li>
        <li>Return beef to the pan. Stir in remaining cup of broth; bring to a simmer and cook on low heat for about 1 hour, covered, until beef is tender and sauce is thick. Stir every 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in crème fraîche. Stir in chives. Season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
