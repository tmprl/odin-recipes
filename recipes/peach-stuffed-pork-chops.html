    <p>For this peach-stuffed pork chops recipe, I'm going to show you my favorite technique for stuffing pork chops, as well as one of my favorite stuffings for pork. </p>
    <p>Above and beyond producing something that's visually impressive, we are also flavoring our pork chops from the inside out with this method</p>
    <p>So, this is basically a technique video and will work no matter what stuffing you decide to use—although this peach stuffing is absolutely delicious.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            2 strips bacon, sliced into ¼-inch pieces
        </li>
        <li>
            &frac12; cup diced onion
        </li> 
        <li>
            2 tablespoons diced poblano pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            1 large yellow peach, peeled, pitted, and diced
        </li>
        <li>
            8 saltine crackers, crushed
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
        </li>
        <li>
            &frac14; teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            &frac14; teaspoon kosher salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pinch cayenne pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons chicken broth, or as needed
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) with oven rack in center position. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and poblano pepper; cook until onion turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add peach; cook until tender and starting to render some juice. Transfer to a bowl. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir saltines, thyme, black pepper, ¼ teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper into peach mixture; add 2 tablespoons chicken broth to moisten as needed. Refrigerate until ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
             Lay pork chops flat onto your work surface. Cut a pocket in center of each pork chop, starting with a small incision on fat side of chops, exactly halfway down, using the tip of a knife to cut as close to the edges as possible without poking through. Try to make pocket incisions at least 2 inches wide.

            Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat. Add chops; sear until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip chops and transfer skillet to the oven. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into centers reads 145 degrees F to 150 degrees F (63 to 66 degrees C), about 15 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer chops to a plate; cover loosely with aluminum foil. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the skillet to the stovetop; place a towel over the hot handle. Add ¼ cup chicken broth and balsamic vinegar; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Off heat, stir in butter. Taste; adjust seasoning if desired. Serve sauce over pork chops.
